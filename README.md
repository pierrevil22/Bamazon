## Node.js & MySQL

This is a Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL database

The app is designed to take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory

The products table should have each of the following columns:

- item_id (unique id for each product)

- product_name (Name of product)

- department_name

- price (cost to customer)

- stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)
